# Preface {.unnumbered}

This material shows how to reproduce examples in and exerciese solutions for Hadley Wickham's [Mastering Shiny](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-shiny/9781492047377/), which originally implemented in R, by using [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/). My material will contain mostly only codes with few additional specific details of Shiny for Python, while it does not contain comprehensive explanation about Shiny framework. To understand Shiny framework, I highly recommend you to read Hadley Wickham's [Mastering Shiny](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-shiny/9781492047377/) first, which [online version](https://mastering-shiny.org) is also available.

The followings are materials that I referenced while creating this material:

- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org) by Hadley Wickham
- [Learn Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/overview.html) by Posit Inc. on Shiny for Python website
- [Shiny R to Python translation guide](https://gist.github.com/wch/616934a6fe57636434154c112ac8a718) by Winston Chang
- [Change Log for Shiny for Python](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Also, I got answers from Shiny community on Discord when I asked questions about implementing several examples. I appreciate great helps from Gordon Shotwell, Joe Cheng, and the community!

Computation environment is as follows:

## Python 

### Python version

```{python} 
!python --version
```

### Packages

```{python}
with open('requirements.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
```


## IDE

### VS Code extensions

- [Shiny for Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=posit.shiny-python)
